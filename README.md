A mobile application that allows the user to summarize any length of text without taking away from important details. Currently only locally deployable, but will go online soon!


## Purpose/Problem ðŸ¤”:
In a digital era characterized by an abundance of information, the challenge lies in determining what's important versus extraneous. For instance, consider the scenario of an individual who misses a crucial class lecture or a vital company meeting on Zoom. To catch up, they must either devote considerable time to watching the entire recording or rely on someone else to provide a comprehensive transcript summary. In both cases, the process requires a substantial investment of effort. SumNation Mobile eliminates that problem, providing a quick and easy way for the user to get to what they need.

- Manages multiple user accounts in the backend
- Supports automatic Google sign in
